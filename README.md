# C++ Portfolio Projects

This repository contains three distinct C++ projects demonstrating different domains of development.

## 1. HOARD
A terminal-based idle/tycoon game featuring:
- **Cloud Saving:** Uses REST APIs (libcurl) to sync data with Firebase.
- **Multithreading:** Handles idle resource gain on a background thread.
- **JSON Parsing:** Serializes and deserializes player data.

## 2. Munch
A local 2-player competitive arcade game using **SFML**:
- **Collision Detection:** Circle-circle collision math.
- **State Management:** Handles win states, score tracking, and resets.
- **Audio/Visual:** Uses external assets for fonts and sound effects.

## 3. N-Body Simulation
A physics simulation of the Solar System using **SFML**:
- **Physics:** Implements the Velocity Verlet integration algorithm for stable orbital mechanics.
- **Optimization:** Simulates gravitational interactions between multiple bodies.
- **Visuals:** Renders real-time trails and planetary positions.
